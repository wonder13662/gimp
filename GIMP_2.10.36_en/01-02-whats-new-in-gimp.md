# 1.2. Whatâ€™s new in GIMP

The best way to keep up-to-date with the latest changes in GIMP is to check the [news](https://www.gimp.org/news/) on our website.

We realize that it would be nice to have localized changes of the latest release that links to relevant pages in our documentation. However, our team just doesn't have enough volunteers to make that happen. We would welcome more people helping out with updating or translating our documentation, so don't hesitate to [contact us](https://docs.gimp.org/help.html)
