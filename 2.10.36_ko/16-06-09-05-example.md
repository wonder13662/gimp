# 16.6.9.5. 색상 관리 활성화 옵션 비활성화 뒤의 보정된 이미지와 보정되지 않은 이미지 비교(Two screenshots showing examples of correct and incorrect image appearances after unchecking Enable Color Management)

In both screenshots shown below, the image is color managed: An ICC profile is assigned to the image, and that profile is being used to send the image colors to the screen.

But in the second screen shot, after unchecking "Enable Color Management", one of GIMP's built-in sRGB profiles has been incorrectly assigned to the image, so the colors look wrong.

## 1. ?
In screenshot 1 below, the image is already in a GIMP built-in sRGB color space.

So unchecking "Enable Color Management" makes no difference in the appearance of the image.

In this particular case unchecking "Enable Color Management" actually makes no difference at all, except that if you've selected to show the image's assigned ICC profile in the title or status bar, then instead of showing the assigned ICC profile, the title or status bar will show the words "not color managed". But in reality the image is still color managed

## 2. ?
In screenshot 2 below, the channel encoding of the original profile matches the GIMP channel encoding (both are linear), but the ProPhoto RGB profile chromaticities don't match the GIMP built-in sRGB chromaticities.

So after unchecking "Enable Color Management", the tonality is correct but the colors are wrong.

The image is still color managed, but it's color managed using the wrong ICC profile:
