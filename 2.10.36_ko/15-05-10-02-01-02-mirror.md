## 3. 붓 변형 비활성화
Disable brush transform:

When you transform the drawing, the brush itself will end up transformed as well.

For instance, in a mirror transform, not only will your drawing on the right of the canvas be mirrored on the left, but the brush itself is obviously "flipped" on the left.

If for some reaons, you want the drawn lines to be mirrored (or other transformation) but not the brush outline itself, you can check this box.

For obvious reason, you won't see it with symmetrical brushes though.

That's why you don't see the effect since many default brushes are symmetrical.
