# 15.5.9.2.3. 포인터 경계 상자(Pointer Bounding Box)
(TODO 포커스 이미지 필요)

This information is active when a selection exists.

X and Y are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle frame that bounds rectangular and ellipse selections.

H and W are the height and width of this box.

This information also exists for the other selections, but they are of less interest and the bounding box is not visible.

This information concerning the selection remains unchanged when you use another tool, while pointer coordinates vary.
