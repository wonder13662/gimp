# 1.1. Welcome to GIMP
GIMP is a multi-platform tool to create and edit images of all kinds. GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program.

GIMP has many capabilities. It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, a tool to create digital art, an online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, an image format converter, etc.

GIMP is expandable and extensible. It is designed to be augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just about anything. The advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest task to the most complex image manipulation procedures to be easily scripted.

One of GIMP's strengths is its free availability from many sources for many operating systems. Most GNU/Linux distributions include GIMP as a standard application. GIMP is also available for other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple's macOS(Darwin). GIMP is a Free Software application covered by the General Public License version 3 [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). The GPL provides users with the freedom to access and alter the source code that makes up computer programs.

## 1.1.1. Authors
The first version of GIMP was written by Peter Mattis and Spencer Kimball. Over the years many other people have contributed by helping with development, testing, providing support, translating and writing documentation. GIMP releases are currently being orchestrated by Mitch Natterer and Jehan Pages and the other members of the GIMP-Team.

## 1.1.2. The GIMP Help System
The GIMP Documentation Team provides the information that tries to help you understand how to use GIMP. The User Manual is an important part of thie help. The latest version is always available on the website of the Documenation Team [GIMP-DOCS](https://www.gimp.org/docs/) in HTML format. The HTML version is also available as context sensitive help (needs to be installed separately) while using GIMP by pressing the `F1` key. Help on specific menu items can be accessed by pressing the `F1` key while the mouse pointer is focused on the menu item. Read on to begin your GIMP journey.
